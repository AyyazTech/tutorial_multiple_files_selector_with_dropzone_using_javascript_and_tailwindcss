# Modern multiple files selector with image preview using vanilla javascript and tailwind css

*Introduction*
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a modern file selector with drag-and-drop functionality and image preview using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

*Building the File Selector*
- Start by building a simple file selector with a "Choose files" button and a dropzone.
- Use Tailwind CSS to style the file selector and give it a modern look.
- Add a hidden file input and a click event listener to the "Choose files" button to handle file selection.

*Adding Drag-and-Drop Support*
- Add event listeners for dragover, dragleave, and drop events to the dropzone to handle drag-and-drop file uploads.
- Use JavaScript to prevent the default behavior of these events and add custom styling to the dropzone when a file is being dragged over it.
- Use the DataTransfer object to access the files that were dropped onto the dropzone.

*Displaying Selected Images*
- Use the URL.createObjectURL() method to display selected images in a preview area.
- Use JavaScript to add a "Remove" button to each selected image to allow users to remove images as needed.
- Update the preview area and the selected files count whenever an image is added or removed.

*Conclusion*
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional file selector with drag-and-drop support and image preview that you can use in your own projects.
